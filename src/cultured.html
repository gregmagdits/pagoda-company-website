						<h4 class='value-heading'>WHAT IS THIS PROJECT ABOUT?</h4>
						<p>
							I knew my first Angular project had to be something that would really leverage the power that a single page application
							could deliver. So I chose something that was sufficiently complicated, a social recipe sharing website, and paired it
							with my love of fermenting things! Thus, Cultured was born.
						</p>

						<p>
							In previous projects I'd used MongoDB, but often found myself trying to wrangle the database into working like
							a relational database. Maybe what I really needed to use was... an actual relational database! Cultured uses
							PostgreSQL to store all data, including detailed user, recipe, and ingredient data. Modeling the returned
							data was tricky, as each recipe was associated with user data, and contained multiple ingredients. I considered using an ORM like
							Sequelize, but decided that making my own would be simple enough for my case, and probably save me a lot of grief.
						</p>

						<p>
							I wanted the server to be stateless, so I took a basic auth approach by using passport.js to authenticate
							the HTTP requests, and pushed the session data onto the client's localStorage. Password encryption is achieved
							using generating a 60 character hashed password using 10 salt rounds. All pages are accessible by a visitor,
							except the recipe creation, recipe editing, my recipes, and my profile pages. Authorization is provided for these
							via an auth-guard middleware which checks credentials for any router request to those pages.
						</p>

						<p>
							Learning how to write an Angular application is challenging, but that's why I picked it. It definitely wants you to do
							things a certain way, and the dependency injection thing can be confusing at first. But after working with it for a bit,
							I can see how incredibly useful it is. Things like structural directives are awesome. I look forward to working with
							Angular more as I finish up Cultured.
